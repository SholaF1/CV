## Shola Forbes

I’m a Software Developer with a background in marketing, programme management, and e-commerce, now expanding my technical skills through the Makers Academy bootcamp. I’m passionate about creating solutions that amplify the voices and representation of underrepresented groups. Currently, I’m combining my interest in Formula 1, motorsports, and tech by developing a Motorsports Platform to increase the visibility of young women in the field. The platform uses APIs to showcase real-time scores and provides valuable resources to support their growth and development.

## Skills

#### Communication
I have developed strong communication skills throughout my career, especially when working with diverse teams and presenting complex ideas to stakeholders. For instance, during my role as Programme Coordinator at Unrest, I regularly coordinated with 100+ speakers and partners, tailoring my communication style to ensure alignment with programme goals and to foster meaningful collaboration. Additionally, I honed my ability to break down technical concepts when leading group projects at Makers Academy, where I often explained key programming concepts to peers who were new to coding. This experience helped me convey complex ideas in a way that was clear, accessible, and impactful for individuals with varying levels of technical expertise.

#### Problem Solving
In my various roles, I've consistently demonstrated a knack for problem-solving, particularly in high-pressure situations. While working as an E-Commerce Coordinator at The Fold London, I was responsible for troubleshooting and resolving technical issues on the online store. I implemented quick and effective solutions to minimise downtime, using debugging skills that I refined during my software engineering training at Makers Academy. My ability to think critically and apply technical solutions also helped during project development, where I identified bottlenecks and devised strategies to streamline workflows and ensure timely delivery of key product launches.

#### Project Coordination
My project coordination skills have been strengthened through years of experience managing teams and delivering projects on time. As Programme Coordinator at Unrest, I successfully led a 16-week startup accelerator programme, supporting over 30 startups. I coordinated cross-functional teams, streamlined resources, and optimised workflows to deliver key programme milestones. This experience is directly transferable to my work as a software developer, where I use similar skills to manage project timelines, ensure efficient collaboration, and handle deliverables within Agile environments. Additionally, I led sprints during my time at The Fold London, which has further enhanced my ability to deliver projects efficiently and within deadlines.

#### Time Management
I have always been highly organised, able to juggle multiple projects and priorities without sacrificing quality. During my time at The Fold London, I managed the online store while simultaneously leading product launches and troubleshooting technical issues. This required me to prioritise tasks effectively and allocate my time in a way that ensured both quick issue resolution and timely project delivery. At Makers Academy, this skill has been further honed as I balance the demands of bootcamp projects with collaborative team work, ensuring all tasks are completed to a high standard and on time.
